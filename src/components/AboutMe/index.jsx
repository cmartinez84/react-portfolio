          "He who wishes to be born must first destroy a world" - Herman Hesse

A reformed Luddite, a quiet observer, a well-tempered cynic, my forray into coding began the winter of 2014, while training a server. "Bedazzled"-her words, as am much more modest in person-by my breadth of food knowledge and obsession for detail, she recommended, without preface or context, I try coding. "No thanks," I said. "I don't do drugs." "Noooo...Coding." (I would later broach the topic to my parents the same way, i.e., "Hey mom, I'm really getting into codeine"). I began working with Codecademy, and while i enjoyed getting my feet wet, I wanted a deeper exploration. Treehouse soon filled the need, and I quickly embraced the process of disciplined problem solving, a process that ran antithetical to the managed calamity and distraction that defines the customer service experience. After much research and asking people in the industry, I decided to take the plunge and enroll in Epicodus.

I thrive on the spaced-out techno stylings of Nina Kraviz, caffeine, regular exercise, and passioantely flavored food. Other dabbles and loves include well-executed dinner parties, amari, beethoven, literature, sociologically oriented non-fiction, US politics, and global history, etymologies and linguisistics. I am a notorious bag of dad-jokes.</div>

        <div className="content-panel">
          <p>I began looking into coding a few years ago now at the suggestion of a friend who suspected I might be interested. And after a year or so of explroing Treehouse and youtube tutorials, I decided to enroll in Epicodus, where I chose the Drupal/PHP/Javascript track. Since  graduating Epicodus and finishing my internship, I've continued to code and explore (mainly Javasript) libraries and other technologies in my free time </p>
          <p>When I'm not codign or working, I enjoy exploring classical and world music, passionately flavored food, Youtube , and reading.</p>

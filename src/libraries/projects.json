    "description":["While every Starbucks barista has a home store, they are free to cover shifts at any local, company-owned store with the same base pay rate. This is tremendously helpful when trying to cover shifts. On the other hands, this flexibility also helps baristas who are willing to work more than scheduled meet their financial needs. Sometimes, we reach out to people in our contacts, but sometimes we need to explore options with complete strangers, and playing phone tag and posting in Facebook groups can be time consuming, and often enough, our needs still go unmet.",   "HABO is my attempt to streamline the process and provide a central solution for swapping shifts",   "Being a problem-drive project turned out to actually be really rewarding process, as I watched my project turn from an idea, to user stories, to actual code. Conversely, I have tried to keep a product that is easy to use and as uncluttered as possible. It's success rides on its ability to relay relevant information to the user.", "Feel free to demo HABO and even POST A SHIFT you'd like to give up or shout out on the left if you're Looking for Hours. Check out the views offered under SHIFTS, play with the distance filter, or perhaps you'd like to see all shifts on a MAP of Portland. This site is currently not being used by baristas, so have don't worry about deleting anything. Click on any preview text in the Message column and see an expanded version on the right side. Click the preview text again and see the store on a map.",   "You will need the folling information to demo the project: User: demo Password: habodemo"

In addition the basic requirements, I created a custom five-star rating system with CSS hover effects and an option to either create basic member profiles -through simple database queries, ie, not a practice in security- or post anonymously. I consider Blorplr an exercise in clean and colorful design and UI as well as a practice in back-end development."],

The game uses two APIs: one to generate tags and the other to generate images."],

Recentia Health believes that technology should be used to help physicians spend more time with their patients, and should support the physician's mission of providing the highest quality health care.

To that end, we are building a national health records bank supporting a healthcare app ecosystem for third party developers.

We are fostering the development of health care apps for physicians and patients by providing creative third party developers who specialize in user experience design with simple APIs to our patient knowledge base; we do the clinical and artificial intelligence heavy lifting necessary to properly manage patient knowledge bases, so that independent developers can focus on what they are best at.

Our first healthcare app is a clinical summary and patient pre-visit checklist for physicians that helps physicians spend less time looking for patient data in EMRs and EHRs, and more time talking with and examining their patients. Our pre-visit checklists help physicians maximize their composite performance scores for the Merit-based Incentive Payment System component of Medicare's new Quality Payment Program (MACRA).
